source venv/bin/activate

*You will see `(venv)` appear at the start of your terminal line.*

### Windows
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in the `flask_mvp` folder and run:
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
venv\Scripts\activate
```

## 3. Install Dependencies
Once the virtual environment is active, install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Run the Application

```bash
python3 app.py
# OR
python app.py
```
